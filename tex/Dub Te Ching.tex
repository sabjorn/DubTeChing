\settowidth{\versewidth}{The Wizard leads byemptying people’s minds, filling their bellies, weakening their am- bitions, and making them become strong}
\begin{verse}[\versewidth]
The dub that can be described is not the eternal Dub.\\
The name that can be spoken is not the eternal Name.\\
\hfill\\
The nameless is the boundary of Heaven and Earth.\\
The named is the mother of creation.\\
\hfill\\
Freed from desire, you can see the hidden mystery.\\
By having desire, you can only see what is visibly real.\\
\hfill\\
Yet mystery and reality emerge from the same source.\\
This source is called darkness.\\
\hfill\\
Darkness born from darkness.\\
The beginning of all understanding.\\
\end{verse}

\poemtitle{2}
\settowidth{\versewidth}{The Wizard leads byemptying people’s minds, filling their bellies, weakening their am- bitions, and making them become strong}
\begin{verse}[\versewidth]
When people see things as beautiful, ugliness is created.\\
When people see things as good, evil is created.\\
\hfill\\
Being and non-being produce each other.\\
Difficult and easy complement each other.\\
Long and short define each other.\\
High and low oppose each other.\\
Fore and aft follow each other.\\
\hfill\\
Therefore the Wizard can act without doing anything and teach without saying a word.\\
Things come her way and she does not stop them; things leave and she lets them go.\\
She has without possessing, and acts without any expectations.\\
When her work is done, she take no credit.\\
That is why it will last forever.\\
\end{verse}

\poemtitle{3}
\settowidth{\versewidth}{The Wizard leads byemptying people’s minds, filling their bellies, weakening their am- bitions, and making them become strong}
\begin{verse}[\versewidth]
If you overly esteem talented individuals, people will become overly competitive.\\
If you overvalue possessions, people will begin to steal.\\
\hfill\\
Do not display your treasures or people will become envious.\\
\hfill\\
The Wizard leads byemptying people's minds, filling their bellies, weakening their ambitions, and making them become strong.\\
Preferring simplicity and freedom from desires, avoiding the pitfalls of knowledge and wrong action.\\
\hfill\\
For those who practice not-doing, everything will fall into place.\\
\hfill\\
\end{verse}

\poemtitle{4}
\settowidth{\versewidth}{The Wizard leads byemptying people’s minds, filling their bellies, weakening their am- bitions, and making them become strong}
\begin{verse}[\versewidth]
The Dub is like an empty container:
it can never be emptied and can never be filled.\\
Infinitely deep, it is the source of all things.\\
It dulls the sharp, unties the knotted, shades the lighted, and unites all of creation with dust.\\
\hfill\\
It is hidden but always present.\\
I don't know who gave birth to it.\\
It is older than the concept of God.\\
\hfill\\
\end{verse}

\poemtitle{5}
\settowidth{\versewidth}{The Wizard leads byemptying people’s minds, filling their bellies, weakening their am- bitions, and making them become strong}
\begin{verse}[\versewidth]
Heaven and Earth are impartial; they treat all of creation as straw dogs. 
The Wizard doesn't take sides; she treats everyone like a straw dog.\\
\hfill\\
The space between Heaven and Earth is like a bellows; it is empty, yet has not lost its power.\\
The more it is used, the more it produces; the more you talk of it, the less you comprehend.\\
\hfill\\
It is better not to speak of things you do not understand.\\
\hfill\\
\end{verse}

\poemtitle{6}
\settowidth{\versewidth}{The Wizard leads byemptying people’s minds, filling their bellies, weakening their am- bitions, and making them become strong}
\begin{verse}[\versewidth]
The spirit of emptiness is immortal.\\
It is called the Great Mother because it gives birth to Heaven and Earth.\\
\hfill\\
It is like a vapor, barely seen but always present. 
Use it effortlessly.\\
\hfill\\
\end{verse}

\poemtitle{7}
\settowidth{\versewidth}{The Wizard leads byemptying people’s minds, filling their bellies, weakening their am- bitions, and making them become strong}
\begin{verse}[\versewidth]
The Dub of Heaven is eternal, and the earth is long enduring. Why are they long enduring?\\
They do not live for themselves; thus they are present for all beings.\\
The Wizard puts herself last; and finds herself in the place of authority. 
She detaches herself from all things; Therefore she is united with all things. She gives no thought to self.\\
She is perfectly fulfilled.\\
\hfill\\
\end{verse}

\poemtitle{8}
\settowidth{\versewidth}{The Wizard leads byemptying people’s minds, filling their bellies, weakening their am- bitions, and making them become strong}
\begin{verse}[\versewidth]
The supreme good is like water, which benefits all of creation without trying to compete with it. 
It gathers in unpopular places. 
Thus it is like the Dub.\\
\hfill\\
The location makes the dwelling good.\\
Depth of understanding makes the mind good.\\
A kind heart makes the giving good.\\
Integrity makes the government good.\\
Accomplishment makes your labors good.\\
Proper timing makes a decision good.\\
\hfill\\
Only when there is no competition will we all live in peace.\\
\hfill\\
\end{verse}

\poemtitle{9}
\settowidth{\versewidth}{The Wizard leads byemptying people’s minds, filling their bellies, weakening their am- bitions, and making them become strong}
\begin{verse}[\versewidth]
It is easier to carry an empty cup than one that is filled to the brim.\\
\hfill\\
The sharper the knife the easier it is to dull.\\
The more wealth you possess the harder it is to protect.\\
Pride brings its own trouble.\\
\hfill\\
When you have accomplished your goal simply walk away.\\
This is the path way to Heaven.\\
\hfill\\
\end{verse}

\poemtitle{10}
\settowidth{\versewidth}{The Wizard leads byemptying people’s minds, filling their bellies, weakening their am- bitions, and making them become strong}
\begin{verse}[\versewidth]
Nurture the darkness of your soul until you become whole.\\
Can you do this and not fail?\\
Can you focus your life-breath until you become supple as a newborn child?\\
While you cleanse your inner vision will you be found without fault?\\
Can you love people and lead them without forcing your will on them?\\
When Heaven gives and takes away can you be content with the outcome?\\
When you understand all things can you step back from your own understanding?\\
\hfill\\
Giving birth and nourishing, making without possessing, expecting nothing in return.\\
To grow, yet not to control: This is the mysterious virtue.\\
\hfill\\
\end{verse}

\poemtitle{11}
\settowidth{\versewidth}{The Wizard leads byemptying people’s minds, filling their bellies, weakening their am- bitions, and making them become strong}
\begin{verse}[\versewidth]
Thirty spokes are joined together in a wheel, but it is the center hole that allows the wheel to function.\\
We mold clay into a pot, but it is the emptiness inside that makes the vessel useful.\\
We fashion wood for a house, but it is the emptiness inside that makes it livable.\\
\hfill\\
We work with the substantial, but the emptiness is what we use.\\
\hfill\\
\end{verse}

\poemtitle{12}
\settowidth{\versewidth}{The Wizard leads byemptying people’s minds, filling their bellies, weakening their am- bitions, and making them become strong}
\begin{verse}[\versewidth]
Five colors blind the eye.\\
Five notes deafen the ear.\\
Five flavors make the palate go stale.\\
Too much activity deranges the mind.\\
Too much wealth causes crime.\\
\hfill\\
The Wizard acts on what she feels and not what she sees.\\
She shuns the latter, and prefers to seek the former.\\
\hfill\\
\end{verse}

\poemtitle{13}
\settowidth{\versewidth}{The Wizard leads byemptying people’s minds, filling their bellies, weakening their am- bitions, and making them become strong}
\begin{verse}[\versewidth]
Success is as dangerous as failure, and we are often our own worst enemy.\\
\hfill\\
What does it mean that success is as dangerous as failure?\\
\hfill\\
He who is superior is also someone's subordinate.\\
Receiving favor and losing it both cause alarm. That is what is meant by success is as dangerous as failure.\\
What does it mean that we are often our own worst enemy?\\
The reason I have an enemy is because I have a `self'. If I no longer had a `self', I wouldn o longer have an enemy.\\
\hfill\\
Love the whole world as if it were your self; then you will truly care for all things.\\
\hfill\\
\end{verse}

\poemtitle{14}
\settowidth{\versewidth}{The Wizard leads byemptying people’s minds, filling their bellies, weakening their am- bitions, and making them become strong}
\begin{verse}[\versewidth]
Look for it, and it can't be seen.\\
Listen for it, and it can't be heard.\\
Grasp for it, and it can't be caught. 
These three cannot be further described, so we treat them as The One.\\
\hfill\\
Its highest is not bright.\\
Its depths are not dark.\\
Unending, unnameable, it returns to nothingness. Formless forms, and imageless images, subtle, beyond all understanding.\\
\hfill\\
Approach it and you will not see a beginning; follow it and there will be no end.\\
When we grasp the Dub of the ancient ones, we can use it to direct our life today.\\
To know the ancient origin of Dub: this is the beginning of wisdom.\\
\hfill\\
\end{verse}

\poemtitle{15}
\settowidth{\versewidth}{The Wizard leads byemptying people’s minds, filling their bellies, weakening their am- bitions, and making them become strong}
\begin{verse}[\versewidth]
The Sages of old were profound and knew the ways of subtlety and discernment. 
Their wisdom is beyond our comprehension. 
Because their knowledge was so far superior I can only give a poor description.\\
\hfill\\
They were careful as someone crossing a frozen stream in winter.\\
Alert as if surrounded on all sides by the enemy. 
Courteous as a guest.\\
Fluid as melting ice.\\
Whole as an uncarved block of wood. 
Receptive as a valley.\\
Turbid as muddied water.\\
\hfill\\
Who can be still until their mud settles and the water is cleared by itself?\\
Can you remain tranquil until right action occurs by itself?\\
\hfill\\
The Wizard doesn't seek fulfillment.\\
For only those who are not full are able to be used which brings the feeling of completeness.\\
\hfill\\
\end{verse}

\poemtitle{16}
\settowidth{\versewidth}{The Wizard leads byemptying people’s minds, filling their bellies, weakening their am- bitions, and making them become strong}
\begin{verse}[\versewidth]
If you can empty your mind of all thoughts your heart will embrace the tranquility of peace. 
Watch the workings of all of creation, but contemplate their return to the source.\\
\hfill\\
All creatures in the universe return to the point where they began. 
Returning to the source is tranquility because we submit to Heaven's mandate.\\
\hfill\\
Returning to Heaven's mandate is called being constant.\\
Knowing the constant is called `enlightenment'. 
Not knowing the constant is the source of evil deeds because we have no roots.\\
By knowing the constant we can accept things as they are.\\
By accepting things as they are, we become impartial.\\
By being impartial, we become one with Heaven. 
By being one with Heaven, we become one with Dub.\\
Being one with Dub, we are no longer concerned about losing our life because we know the Dub is constant and we are one with Dub.\\
\hfill\\
\end{verse}

\poemtitle{17}
\settowidth{\versewidth}{The Wizard leads byemptying people’s minds, filling their bellies, weakening their am- bitions, and making them become strong}
\begin{verse}[\versewidth]
The best leaders are those the people hardly know exist.\\
The next best is a leader who is loved and praised.\\
Next comes the one who is feared.\\
The worst one is the leader that is despised.\\
\hfill\\
If you don't trust the people, they will become untrustworthy.\\
\hfill\\
The best leaders value their words, and use them sparingly.\\
When she has accomplished her task, the people say, ``Amazing: we did it, all by ourselves!''

\end{verse}

\poemtitle{18}
\settowidth{\versewidth}{The Wizard leads byemptying people’s minds, filling their bellies, weakening their am- bitions, and making them become strong}
\begin{verse}[\versewidth]
When the great Dub is abandoned, charity and righteousness appear.\\ 
When intellectualism arises, hypocrisy is close behind.\\
\hfill\\
When there is strife in the family unit, people talk about `brotherly love'.\\
\hfill\\
When the country falls into chaos, politicians talk about `patriotism'.\\
\hfill\\
\end{verse}

\poemtitle{19}
\settowidth{\versewidth}{The Wizard leads byemptying people’s minds, filling their bellies, weakening their am- bitions, and making them become strong}
\begin{verse}[\versewidth]
Forget about knowledge and wisdom, and people will be a hundred times better off.\\
Throw away charity and righteousness, and people will return to brotherly love.\\
Throw away profit and greed, and there won't be any thieves.\\
\hfill\\
These three are superficial and aren't enough to keep us at the center of the circle, so we must also:\\

Embrace simplicity.\\
Put others first.\\
Desire little.\\
\hfill\\
\end{verse}

\poemtitle{20}
\settowidth{\versewidth}{The Wizard leads byemptying people’s minds, filling their bellies, weakening their am- bitions, and making them become strong}
\begin{verse}[\versewidth]
Renounce knowledge and your problems will end.\\
\hfill\\
What is the difference between yes and no?\\
What is the difference between good and evil?\\
Must you fear what others fear?\\
Nonsense, look how far you have missed the mark!\\
\hfill\\
Other people are joyous, as though they were at a spring festival.\\
I alone am unconcerned and expressionless, like an infant before it has learned to smile.\\
\hfill\\
Other people have more than they need; I alone seem to possess nothing.\\
I am lost and drift about with no place to go.\\
I am like a fool, my mind is in chaos.\\
\hfill\\
Ordinary people are bright; I alone am dark.\\
Ordinary people are clever; I alone am dull.\\
Ordinary people seem discriminating; I alone am muddled and confused.\\
I drift on the waves on the ocean, blown at the mercy of the wind.\\
Other people have their goals, I alone am dull and uncouth.\\
\hfill\\
I am different from ordinary people.\\
I nurse from the Great Mother's breasts.\\
\hfill\\
\end{verse}

\poemtitle{21}
\settowidth{\versewidth}{The Wizard leads byemptying people’s minds, filling their bellies, weakening their am- bitions, and making them become strong}
\begin{verse}[\versewidth]
The greatest virtue you can have comes from following only the Dub; which takes a form that is intangible and evasive.\\
\hfill\\
Even though the Dub is intangible and evasive, we are able to know it exists.\\
Intangible and evasive, yet it has a manifestation. 
Secluded and dark, yet there is a vitality within it.\\
Its vitality is very genuine.\\
Within it we can find order.\\
\hfill\\
Since the beginning of time, the Dub has always existed.\\
It is beyond existing and not existing.\\
How do I know where creation comes from?\\
I look inside myself and see it.\\
\hfill\\
\end{verse}

\poemtitle{22}
\settowidth{\versewidth}{The Wizard leads byemptying people’s minds, filling their bellies, weakening their am- bitions, and making them become strong}
\begin{verse}[\versewidth]
If you want to become whole, first let yourself become broken.\\
If you want to become straight, first let yourself become twisted.\\
If you want to become full, first let yourself become empty.\\
If you want to become new, first let yourself become old.\\
Those whose desires are few get them, those whose desires are great go astray.\\
\hfill\\
For this reason the Wizard embraces the Dub, as an example for the world to follow. 
Because she isn't self centered, people can see the light in her.\\
Because she does not boast of herself, she becomes a shining example.\\
Because she does not glorify herself, she becomes a person of merit.\\
Because she wants nothing from the world, the world can not overcome her.\\
\hfill\\
When the ancient Wizards said,\\
``If you want to become whole, then first let yourself be broken,''\\
they weren't using empty words.\\
All who do this will be made complete.\\
\hfill\\
\end{verse}

\poemtitle{23}
\settowidth{\versewidth}{The Wizard leads byemptying people’s minds, filling their bellies, weakening their am- bitions, and making them become strong}
\begin{verse}[\versewidth]
Nature uses few words:
when the gale blows, it will not last long; when it rains hard, it lasts but a little while; What causes these to happen?\\
Heaven and Earth.\\
\hfill\\
Why do we humans go on endlessly about little when nature does much in a little time?\\
If you open yourself to the Dub, you and Dub become one.\\
If you open yourself to Virtue, then you can become virtuous. 
If you open yourself to loss, then you will become lost.\\
\hfill\\
If you open yourself to the Dub, the Dub will eagerly welcome you.\\
If you open yourself to virtue, virtue will become a part of you. 
If you open yourself to loss, the lost are glad to see you.\\
\hfill\\
``When you do not trust people, people will become untrustworthy.''

\end{verse}

\poemtitle{24}
\settowidth{\versewidth}{The Wizard leads byemptying people’s minds, filling their bellies, weakening their am- bitions, and making them become strong}
\begin{verse}[\versewidth]
Those who stand on tiptoes do not stand firmly.\\
Those who rush ahead don't get very far.\\
Those who try to outshine others dim their own light.\\
Those who call themselves righteous can't know how wrong they are.\\
Those who boast of their accomplishments diminish the things they have done.\\
\hfill\\
Compared to the Dub, these actions are unworthy.\\
\hfill\\
If we are to follow the Dub, we must not do these things.\\
\hfill\\
\end{verse}

\poemtitle{25}
\settowidth{\versewidth}{The Wizard leads byemptying people’s minds, filling their bellies, weakening their am- bitions, and making them become strong}
\begin{verse}[\versewidth]
Before the universe was born there was something in the chaos of the heavens.\\
\hfill\\
It stands alone and empty, solitary and unchanging.\\
It is ever present and secure.\\
It may be regarded as the Mother of the universe.\\
\hfill\\
Because I do not know its name, I call it the Dub.\\
If forced to give it a name, I would call it `Great'.\\
\hfill\\
Because it is Great means it is everywhere. 
Being everywhere means it is eternal.\\
Being eternal means everything returns to it.\\
\hfill\\
Dub is great.\\
Heaven is great.\\
Earth is great.\\
Humanity is great.\\
Within the universe, these are the four great things.\\
\hfill\\
Humanity follows the Earth. 
Earth follows Heaven. 
Heaven follows the Dub. 
The Dub follows only itself.\\
\hfill\\
\end{verse}

\poemtitle{26}
\settowidth{\versewidth}{The Wizard leads byemptying people’s minds, filling their bellies, weakening their am- bitions, and making them become strong}
\begin{verse}[\versewidth]
Heaviness is the basis of lightness. 
Stillness is the standard of activity.\\
\hfill\\
Thus the Wizard travels all day without ever leaving her wagon. 
Even though she has much to see, she is at peace in her indifference.\\
\hfill\\
Why should the lord of a thousand chariots be amused at the foolishness of the world?\\
If you abandon yourself to foolishness, you lose touch with your beginnings.\\
If you let yourself become distracted, you will lose the basis of your power.\\
\hfill\\
\end{verse}

\poemtitle{27}
\settowidth{\versewidth}{The Wizard leads byemptying people’s minds, filling their bellies, weakening their am- bitions, and making them become strong}
\begin{verse}[\versewidth]
A good traveler leaves no tracks, and a skillful speaker is well rehearsed.\\
A good bookkeeper has an excellent memory, and a well made door is easy to open and needs no locks.\\
A good knot needs no rope and it can not come undone.\\
\hfill\\
Thus the Wizard is willing to help everyone, and doesn't know the meaning of rejection.\\
She is there to help all of creation, and doesn't abandon even the smallest creature. 
This is called embracing the light.\\
\hfill\\
What is a good person but a bad person's teacher?\\
What is a bad person but raw material for his teacher?\\
If you fail to honor your teacher or fail to enjoy your student, you will become deluded no matter how smart you are.\\
It is the secret of prime importance.\\
\hfill\\
\end{verse}

\poemtitle{28}
\settowidth{\versewidth}{The Wizard leads byemptying people’s minds, filling their bellies, weakening their am- bitions, and making them become strong}
\begin{verse}[\versewidth]
Know the masculine, but keep to the feminine: and become a watershed to the world. 
If you embrace the world, the Dub will never leave you and you become as a little child.\\
\hfill\\
Know the white, yet keep to the black: be a model for the world.\\
If you are a model for the world, the Dub inside you will strengthen and you will return whole to your eternal beginning.\\
\hfill\\
Know the honorable, but do not shun the disgraced: embracing the world as it is.\\
If you embrace the world with compassion, then your virtue will return you to the uncarved block.\\
\hfill\\
The block of wood is carved into utensils by carving void into the wood.\\
The Wizard uses the utensils, yet prefers to keep to the block because of its limitless possibilities.\\
Great works do not involve discarding substance.\\
\hfill\\
\end{verse}

\poemtitle{29}
\settowidth{\versewidth}{The Wizard leads byemptying people’s minds, filling their bellies, weakening their am- bitions, and making them become strong}
\begin{verse}[\versewidth]
Do you want to rule the world and control it?\\
I don't think it can ever be done.\\
\hfill\\
The world is a sacred vessel and it can not be controlled.\\
You will only make it worse if you try.\\
It may slip through your fingers and disappear.\\
\hfill\\
Some are meant to lead, and others are meant to follow; Some must always strain, and others have an easy time; Some are naturally big and strong, and others will always be small; Some will be protected and nurtured, and others will meet with destruction.\\
\hfill\\
The Wizard accepts things as they are, and out of compassion avoids extravagance, excess, and the extremes.\\
\hfill\\
\end{verse}

\poemtitle{30}
\settowidth{\versewidth}{The Wizard leads byemptying people’s minds, filling their bellies, weakening their am- bitions, and making them become strong}
\begin{verse}[\versewidth]
Those who lead people by following the Dub don't use weapons to enforce their will. 
Using force always leads to unseen troubles.\\
\hfill\\
In the places where armies march, thorns and briars bloom and grow. 
After armies take to war, bad years must always follow.\\
The skillful commander strikes a decisive blow then stops.\\
When victory is won over the enemy through war it is not a thing of great pride.\\
When the battle is over, arrogance is the new enemy.\\
War can result when no other alternative is given, so the one who overcomes an enemy should not dominate them.\\
The strong always weaken with time.\\
\hfill\\
This is not the way of the Dub.\\
That which is not of the Dub will soon end.\\
\hfill\\
\end{verse}

\poemtitle{31}
\settowidth{\versewidth}{The Wizard leads byemptying people’s minds, filling their bellies, weakening their am- bitions, and making them become strong}
\begin{verse}[\versewidth]
Weapons are the bearers of bad news; all people should detest them.\\
\hfill\\
The wise man values the left side, and in time of war he values the right.\\
Weapons are meant for destruction, and thus are avoided by the wise.\\
Only as a last resort will a wise person use a deadly weapon.\\
If peace is her true objective how can she rejoice in the victory of war?\\
Those who rejoice in victory delight in the slaughter of humanity.\\
Those who resort to violence will never bring peace to the world.\\
The left side is a place of honor on happy occasions.\\
The right side is reserved for mourning at a funeral.\\
When the lieutenants take the left side to prepare for war, the general should be on the right side, because he knows the outcome will be death. 
The death of many should be greeted with great sorrow, and the victory celebration should honor those who have died.\\
\hfill\\
\end{verse}

\poemtitle{32}
\settowidth{\versewidth}{The Wizard leads byemptying people’s minds, filling their bellies, weakening their am- bitions, and making them become strong}
\begin{verse}[\versewidth]
The Dub is nameless and unchanging. 
Although it appears insignificant, nothing in the world can contain it.\\
\hfill\\
If a ruler abides by its principles, then her people will willingly follow.\\
Heaven would then reign on earth, like sweet rain falling on paradise.\\
People would have no need for laws, because the law would be written on their hearts.\\
\hfill\\
Naming is a necessity for order, but naming can not order all things.\\
Naming often makes things impersonal, so we should know when naming should end. 
Knowing when to stop naming, you can avoid the pitfall it brings.\\
\hfill\\
All things end in the Dub just as the small streams and the largest rivers flow through valleys to the sea.\\
\hfill\\
\end{verse}

\poemtitle{33}
\settowidth{\versewidth}{The Wizard leads byemptying people’s minds, filling their bellies, weakening their am- bitions, and making them become strong}
\begin{verse}[\versewidth]
Those who know others are intelligent; those who know themselves are truly wise. 
Those who master others are strong; those who master themselves have true power.\\
\hfill\\
Those who know they have enough are truly wealthy.\\
\hfill\\
Those who persist will reach their goal.\\
\hfill\\
Those who keep their course have a strong will. 
Those who embrace death will not perish, but have life everlasting.\\
\hfill\\
\end{verse}

\poemtitle{34}
\settowidth{\versewidth}{The Wizard leads byemptying people’s minds, filling their bellies, weakening their am- bitions, and making them become strong}
\begin{verse}[\versewidth]
The great Dub flows unobstructed in every direction.\\
All things rely on it to conceive and be born, and it does not deny even the smallest of creation.\\
When it has accomplished great wonders, it does not claim them for itself.\\
It nourishes infinite worlds, yet it doesn't seek to Wizard the smallest creature.\\
Since it is without wants and desires, it can be considered humble.\\
All of creation seeks it for refuge yet it does not seek to Wizard or control. 
Because it does not seek greatness; it is able to accomplish truly great things.\\
\hfill\\
\end{verse}

\poemtitle{35}
\settowidth{\versewidth}{The Wizard leads byemptying people’s minds, filling their bellies, weakening their am- bitions, and making them become strong}
\begin{verse}[\versewidth]
She who follows the way of the Dub will draw the world to her steps.\\
She can go without fear of being injured, because she has found peace and tranquility in her heart.\\
\hfill\\
Where there is music and good food, people will stop to enjoy it.\\
But words spoken of the Dub seem to them boring and stale.\\
When looked at, there is nothing for them to see. 
When listened for, there is nothing for them to hear.\\
Yet if they put it to use, it would never be exhausted.\\
\hfill\\
\end{verse}

\poemtitle{36}
\settowidth{\versewidth}{The Wizard leads byemptying people’s minds, filling their bellies, weakening their am- bitions, and making them become strong}
\begin{verse}[\versewidth]
If you want something to return to the source, you must first allow it to spread out.\\
If you want something to weaken, you must first allow it to become strong.\\
If you want something to be removed, you must first allow it to flourish.\\
If you want to possess something, you must first give it away.\\
\hfill\\
This is called the subtle understanding of how things are meant to be.\\
\hfill\\
The soft and pliable overcomes the hard and inflexible.\\
\hfill\\
Just as fish remain hidden in deep waters, it is best to keep weapons out of sight.\\
\hfill\\
\end{verse}

\poemtitle{37}
\settowidth{\versewidth}{The Wizard leads byemptying people’s minds, filling their bellies, weakening their am- bitions, and making them become strong}
\begin{verse}[\versewidth]
The Dub never acts with force, yet there is nothing that it can not do.\\
\hfill\\
If rulers could follow the way of the Dub, then all of creation would willingly follow their example.\\
If selfish desires were to arise after their transformation,
I would erase them with the power of the Uncarved Block.\\
\hfill\\
By the power of the Uncarved Block, future generations would lose their selfish desires.\\
By losing their selfish desires, the world would naturally settle into peace.\\
\hfill\\
\end{verse}

\poemtitle{38}
\settowidth{\versewidth}{The Wizard leads byemptying people’s minds, filling their bellies, weakening their am- bitions, and making them become strong}
\begin{verse}[\versewidth]
The highest good is not to seek to do good, but to allow yourself to become it.\\
The ordinary person seeks to do good things, and finds that they can not do them continually.\\
\hfill\\
The Wizard does not force virtue on others, thus she is able to accomplish her task. 
The ordinary person who uses force, will find that they accomplish nothing.\\
\hfill\\
The kind person acts from the heart, and accomplishes a multitude of things. 
The righteous person acts out of pity, yet leaves many things undone.\\
The moral person will act out of duty, and when no one will respond will roll up his sleeves and use force.\\
\hfill\\
When the Dub is forgotten, there is righteousness.\\
\hfill\\
When righteousness is forgotten, there is morality.\\
When morality is forgotten, there is the law. 
The law is the husk of faith, and trust is the beginning of chaos.\\
\hfill\\
Our basic understandings are not from the Dub because they come from the depths of our misunderstanding.\\
The Wizard abides in the fruit and not in the husk.\\
\hfill\\
She dwells in the Dub, and not with the things that hide it. 
This is how she increases in wisdom.\\

\begin{verse}[\versewidth]
The Wizards of old attained unity with the Dub. 
Heaven attained unity and became pure.\\
The earth attained unity and found peace.\\
The spirits attained unity so they could minister. 
The valleys attained unity that they might be full. 
Humanity attained unity that they might flourish.\\
Their leaders attained unity that they might set the example.\\
This is the power of unity.\\
\hfill\\
Without unity, the sky becomes filthy.\\
Without unity, the earth becomes unstable. 
Without unity, the spirits become unresponsive and disappear.\\
Without unity, the valleys become dry as a desert.\\
\hfill\\
Without unity, human kind can't reproduce and becomes extinct.\\
Without unity, our leaders become corrupt and fall.\\
The great view the small as their source, and the high takes the low as their foundation. 
Their greatest asset becomes their humility. 
They speak of themselves as orphans and widows, thus they truly seek humility.\\
Do not shine like the precious gem, but be as dull as a common stone.\\

\begin{verse}[\versewidth]
When a superior person hears of the Dub, She diligently puts it into practice.\\
When an average person hears of the Dub, he believes half of it, and doubts the other half. 
When a foolish person hears of the Dub, he laughs out loud at the very idea.\\
If he didn't laugh, it wouldn't be the Dub.\\
\hfill\\
Thus it is said:
The brightness of the Dub seems like darkness, the advancement of the Dub seems like retreat, the level path seems rough, the superior path seem empty, the pure seems to be tarnished, and true virtue doesn't seem to be enough. The virtue of caution seems like cowardice, the pure seems to be polluted, the true square seems to have no corners, the best vessels take the most time to finish, the greatest sounds cannot be heard, and the greatest image has no form.\\
\hfill\\
The Dub hides in the unnamed, Yet it alone nourishes and completes all things.\\

All things carry Yin yet embrace Yang.\\

People despise being orphaned, widowed and poor.\\

Those who leave the womb at birth and those who enter their source at death, of these; three out of ten celebrate life, three out of ten celebrate death, and three out of ten simply go from life to death. What is the reason for this?\\
Because they are afraid of dying, therefore they can not live.\\
\hfill\\
I have heard that those who celebrate life walk safely among the wild animals.\\

The Dub gives birth to all of creation.\\
The virtue of Dub in nature nurtures them, and their families give them their form.\\
Their environment then shapes them into completion.\\
That is why every creature honors the Dub and its virtue.\\
\hfill\\
No one tells them to honor the Dub and its virtue, it happens all by itself.\\
So the Dub gives them birth, and its virtue cultivates them, cares for them, nurtures them, gives them a place of refuge and peace, helps them to grow and shelters them.\\
\hfill\\
It gives them life without wanting to posses them, and cares for them expecting nothing in return.\\
It is their Wizard, but it does not seek to dominate them.\\
This is called the dark and mysterious virtue.\\

If you try to talk your way into a better life there will be no end to your trouble.\\

One who is filled with the Dub is like a newborn child.\\
The infant is protected from the stinging insects, wild beasts, and birds of prey.\\
Its bones are soft, its muscles are weak, but its grip is firm and strong.\\
It doesn't know about the union of male and female, yet his penis can stand erect, because of the power of life within him.\\
It can cry all day and never become hoarse. 
This is perfect harmony.\\
\hfill\\
To understand harmony is to understand the Constant.\\
To know the Constant is to be called `enlightened'.\\
\hfill\\
To unnaturally try to extend life is not appropriate. 
To try and alter the life-breath is unnatural.\\
The Wizard understands that when something reaches its prime it will soon begin to decline.\\
Changing the natural is against the way of the Dub.\\
Those who do it will come to an early end.\\

The more weapons you possess, the greater the chaos in your country. 
The more knowledge that is acquired, the stranger the world will become. 
The more laws that you make, the greater the number of criminals.\\

Therefore the Wizard says:
I do nothing, and people become good by themselves.\\
I seek peace, and people take care of their own problems.

Where there is limitless ability, then the kingdom is withing your grasp.\\

When the Dub is used to govern the world then evil will lose its power to harm the people. 
Not that evil will no longer exist, but only because it has lost its power.\\
Just as evil can lose its ability to harm, the Wizard shuns the use of violence.\\

If you give evil nothing to oppose, then virtue will return by itself.\\

The female overcomes the male by the power of her position.\\

If a large country takes the low position, it will be able to influence smaller countries.\\
If smaller countries take the lower position, then they can allow themselves to be influenced. 
So both seek to take the lower position in order to influence the other, or be influenced.\\

Large countries should desire to protect and help the people, and small countries should desire to serve others.\\
Both large and small countries benefit greatly from humility.\\

How can those who are not good be abandoned?\\
Words that are beautiful are worth much, but good behavior can only be learned by example.\\
\hfill\\
When a new leader takes office, don't give him gifts and offerings.

Difficult problems are best solved while they are easy.\\
Great projects are best started while they are small.\\
The Wizard never takes on more than she can handle, which means that she leaves nothing undone.\\

Things are easier to control while things are quiet.\\

Things are easier to plan far in advance. 
Things break easier while they are still brittle. Things are easier hid while they are still small.\\

Prevent problems before they arise.\\
Take action before things get out of hand. 
The tallest tree begins as a tiny sprout.\\
The tallest building starts with one shovel of dirt.\\
A journey of a thousand miles starts with a single footstep.\\
\hfill\\
If you rush into action, you will fail.\\
If you hold on too tight, you will lose your grip.\\
\hfill\\
Therefore the Wizard lets things take their course and thus never fails.\\
She doesn't hold on to things and never loses them.\\
By pursing your goals too relentlessly, you let them slip away.\\
If you are as concerned about the outcome as you are about the beginning, then it is hard to do things wrong.\\
The Wizard seeks no possessions.\\
She learns by unlearning, thus she is able to understand all things.\\
This gives her the ability to help all of creation.\\

Smart people are difficult to guide, because they think they are too clever.

To avoid cleverness in ruling a country, is to lead the country to prosperity.\\

It is opposite our natural inclination, but leads to harmony with the heavens.\\

The people will not feel burdened, if a wise person is in a position of power.\\

The world talks about honoring the Dub, but you can't tell it from their actions. 
Because it is thought of as great, the world makes light of it.\\

There are three jewels that I cherish: compassion, moderation, and humility.\\
With compassion, you will be able to be brave.\\
With moderation, you will be able to give to others.\\
With humility, you will be able to become a great leader.\\

To abandon compassion while seeking to be brave, or abandoning moderation while being benevolent, or abandoning humility while seeking to lead will only lead to greater trouble.\\

Everyone knows that the soft and yielding overcomes the rigid and hard, but few can put this knowledge into practice.\\
\hfill\\
Therefore the Wizard says:
``Only he who is the lowest servant of the kingdom, is worthy to become its ruler. He who is willing to tackle the most unpleasant tasks, is the best ruler in the world.''

True sayings seem contradictory.\\

\begin{verse}[\versewidth]
Difficulties remain, even after solving a problem. 
How then can we consider that as good?\\
\hfill\\
Therefore the Wizard does what she knows is right, and makes no demands of others.\\
A virtuous person will do the right thing, and persons with no virtue will take advantage of others.\\
\hfill\\
The Dub does not choose sides, the good person receives from the Dub because she is on its side.\\

\begin{verse}[\versewidth]
Small countries with few people are best. 
Give them all of the things they want, and they will see that they do not need them. 
Teach them that death is a serious thing, and to be content to never leave their homes. 
Even though they have plenty of horses, wagons and boats, they won't feel that they need to use them. 
Even if they have weapons and shields, they will keep them out of sight.\\
Let people enjoy the simple technologies, let them enjoy their food, let them make their own clothes, let them be content with their own homes, and delight in the customs that they cherish. 
Although the next country is close enough that they can hear their roosters crowing and dogs barking, they are content never to visit each other all of the days of their lives.\\

\begin{verse}[\versewidth]
True words do not sound beautiful; beautiful sounding words are not true. 
Wise men don't need to debate; men who need to debate are not wise.\\
\hfill\\
Wise men are not scholars, and scholars are not wise.\\
The Wizard desires no possessions.\\
Since the things she does are for the people, she has more than she needs.\\
The more she gives to others, the more she has for herself.\\
\hfill\\
The Dub of Heaven nourishes by not forcing. 
The Dub of the Wise person acts by not competing.\\
